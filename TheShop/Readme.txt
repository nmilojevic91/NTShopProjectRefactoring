This is a refactoring exercise in C#, meaning you can change internal structure without changing the externally visible behaviour.
Code is really simple. There's a ShopService that has the ability to display, order and sell the items. 
Client code (Program.cs) orders and sells items and also displays those that he has been able to find and those that he hasn't been able to find in the Shop.
When ordering an article, Shop needs to find the article amongst the given suppliers where they have it in stock and where the price is not more expensive than the maximum price a client is ready to pay for.
If naming and structure doesn't suit you, fell free to change them.
This is a small exercise and it shouldn't take more of an hour or two of your time.
Introducing tests to the existing code is more than welcome.
Once you're finished with coding send us your code via email or URL to your GitHub/Bitbucket repository. Please include your source control history.
